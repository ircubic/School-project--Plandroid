User interviews
*  First interview

   Interview focusing on initial data gathering, loosely formulated. The points
   below are just points to touch upon, not hard-and-fast questions to follow in
   order. Focus on unique insights.

   1. Have you ever used Facebook events? Ever made one yourself?

   2. Have you ever used location-based services such as Gowalla, Foursquare,
      Yelp, Facebook places, or similar?

   3. If you could improve something in either of these (particularly FB Events),
      what would it be?

   4. Would you use an application that lets you plan simple events on a map,
      notify/invite your friends and uses location-based services to track
      check-ins and such.

   5. How would you prefer that such an application notifies you?

   6. Would you allow the application access to your Facebook info to allow the
      application to better recommend and rank events, and other recommendation
      tasks?
