# Project scope #
The scope of this project is to focus on the user interaction with the map view
and the use of the social graph as a tool for making interaction with the
application more personal. The rest of the application will be handled
peripherally, and on surface level.

## Goals ##

The main goals for usability is for the system to be intuitive (and thus easy to
pick up and use), it should be efficient, and it should be effective both at
notifying about events (so that one does not need the device open to check
continously) and planning events quickly.

The user experience should be smooth and pleasing, the users should feel that
the application is useful to them and helps them get an overview of what their
friends are doing. However, the application should strive not to be imposing,
and notifications should not be intrusive and should be silencable. The ultimate
goal for the application is to be a nice tool to help friends keep connected and
make it easy to find things to do in an asynchronous manner, without the need
for endless rounds of calls.

## User paths ##
The paths through the application that will be covered are:

 * Event creation. From map view, list view and menu.
 * Event discovery and attendance on map view.
 * Checking into event. Either via GPS or manually.
