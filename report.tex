\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

There are already solutions for planning events socially, through Facebook
Events and similar platforms, there are also solutions for location-based
services. However, there are no services that integrate the two in a seamless
manner, and both types of services have traditionally had separate focuses.

In addition, the person planning the event still has to conduct several
conversations with people if the events that are planned rely heavily on the
availability of the invited participants, as there are currently no good
solutions for automating schedule conflict resolution and making use of
information across different social networks to aid this.

The focus of this solution is on mobile platforms, a set of platforms which is
ill-suited to do data entry on\cite{brown:fourkey}. It would be preferable to
avoid as much data entry as possible, which could be facilitated by accessing
social networks, both for initial data import, or as live data sources. This
would greatly cut down on the amount of annoying typing that needs to be done on
the device, as well as minimize data duplication.

\section{Motivation}

The aim of this report is to design a social event planning application, from
hereon called Plandroid, that focuses on low-key, day-to-day events, utilizes
already existing social networks to give recommendations, uses the information
stored in the networks to streamline event creation, and a map-based view. The
type of events planned are intended to be the personal, small-scale variants,
like ``we're going to lunch, where do we want to go?'', ``I'm having a movie get
together, who wants to come'', as opposed to big-scale events like concerts,
movie showings and similar.

The motivation for this is to explore what benefits, if any, people can get from
using mobile devices to streamline inherently social day-to-day tasks, and if
modern tools like the social graph and recommendation systems can improve on how
they are done, and make friends feel more intimately connected. This report will
most directly focus on automated schedule negotiation while planning events
using information gathered from social networks.

\section{Context}
This report was written in conjunction with the Mobile Applications course at
H\o{}gskolen i \O{}stfold\cite{site:mobapp} during the spring semester of 2011.

\section{Previous and related work}

\subsection{Related research}

Although there are few, if any, solutions for doing automated schedule
negotiation through social networks, there has been research on automating or
helping schedule negotiation via semi-autonomous
agents\cite{haynes97:_autom_meetin_sched_system,sen97:_devel,benhassine07},
mostly focusing on scheduling meetings during the age of emails.

Automated negotiations in the business world can also be deemed relevant, as
schedule negotiation is essentially a negotiation over a personal resource,
time, and there has been some research on this as
well\cite{Beam97automatednegotiations:}.

\subsection{Similar solutions}

\begin{description}
\item[Belugapods] A group-based messaging service that allows conversation
  within ``pods'', groups you can subscribe to, allowing for simple group
  conversations or planning.\cite{site:belugapods}
\item[Facebook (events)] Facebook has support for planning events, although as a
  peripheral functionality. It does not support showing events on a map
  directly, though you can list an entry from Places as destination, which you
  can click through to for a map.\cite{site:facebook}
\item[Facebook (places)] Places allows location-based check-ins, and shows the
  place on a map, but does not support tighter integration with events.\cite{site:facebook}
\item[Foursquare] A game that uses location-based check-ins, which gives you
  badges for accomplishing certain tasks or going to certain places. It also
  allows you to give tips about places.\cite{site:foursquare}
\item[Gowalla] Similar to foursquare.\cite{site:gowalla}\marginpar{Fill out more here}

\chapter{Methods}

\section{Phases}

The method I intend to use in designing Plandroid will go through the phases of
Discovery, Design and Evaluation. The execution of the phases will be described
in detail in further sections, but a quick summary of what they will contain is
given:

\begin{description}
\item[Discovery] In the discovery phase, data is gathered to attempt to get an
  overview of what's already out there, what problems existing solutions have,
  what the potential users of the application want, and other useful info.
\item[Design] In the design phase, the data gathered so far is processed, and a
  prototype for the application (of any level of completeness) is created from
  it.
\item[Evaluation] The design is evaluated through user tests and/or other,
  heuristic, tests. If these tests indicate that the current prototype is not
  good enough, we return to the design phase to make another.
\end{description}

To drive the process along I will be taking a heavily user-centered approach, as
described by Preece, Rogers and Sharp\cite{preece07:_inter_desig}, by involving
users early and throughout the process, as well as using an iterative approach
if time allows. I will also keep the 5W+H\cite{heim08:_reson_inter} in the back
of my mind during the process.

\subsection{Discovery}

In the discovery phase, I first started by gathering data I needed before
starting the project proper. I started going over solutions that already
existed, what I thought was good and bad about their solutions with regard to my
initial goal.

With this information in hand, I designed my first set of interview questions,
to be used loosely in my first interview session. This session was done with
three potential users, and helped a lot in narrowing down and shaping my goal
to the way it is described in the Motivation section. Parallel to this I created
a requirements document for the application I would design, focusing most on the
area I had narrowed down as the goal area for my report.

With this information in hand, I would enter the design phase with the intent of
creating a functional prototype.

\subsection{Design}

\subsubsection{Personas}

As a help for the design process, I have created three personas that describes
main sections of the user base I'm expecting for my application. These will be a
help when evaluating requirements and design decisions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Richard is a 21-year old college student, studying Economy. He has decent
  computer skills, and uses Facebook like most of his friends, but doesn't spend
  a lot of time on it. He recently got a smart-phone running Android, and uses a
  small selection of apps like Facebook, Email, and some games, although he
  still uses his phone most for texting and calling. In his spare time he hangs
  out with fellow students, goes to the gym to stay in shape, and likes to bike.
\item Ashley is an 18-year old college student, studying Computer Science. She
  is considered a power-user, even for a CS-student, and is a so-called Early
  Adopter, that likes to try out the newest shiny social networks and
  services. She has had an Android phone since they came out, and fills her
  phone memory with as many apps as she can find, swapping them out at a rapid
  pace. In her spare time she likes to hang out with friends, arrange gaming
  nights, and likes to go rock-climbing occasionally.
\item Michael is a 34-year old working in the entertainment industry as a
  designer. He uses a MacBook for his day-to-day work, and values good design in
  his applications. Despite this, he owns an Android phone, because it was
  cheaper. As a father of two, he spends a lot of his spare time with his
  family, but also likes getting together with his buddies from time to time to
  have lunch or a beer.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{First prototype}

In the design phase, I created a functional prototype of the application in the
form of an Android application. This application was hard-coded to be used with
the following set of scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item The user creates an event with no conflicts, to be used for general
  commentary on flow, and as baseline.
\item The user creates a small, personal event with only a 10\% conflict rate,
  and has to handle the conflict. Handles the ``minor conflict'' case.
\item The user creates a small, personal event with a 50\% conflict rate, and
  has to handle the conflict. Handles the ``major conflict'' case.
\end{itemize}

The application was then tested with five users as detailed in the following
section.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

In the evaluation phase, I used the prototype created in the Design phase, then
run them through user tests. These user tests focused on running the users
through various tasks, observing their behaviour, how intuitive the design is,
as well as if displayed screens match user's expectations. These tests were
designed to answer a set of questions determined before the test was created.

In addition, informal interview or question sessions were held after these user
tests to answer any questions left over, as well to gather the user's general
opinion on the interface, and answer questions that are peripheral to the
prototype.

The design was then evaluated against the final evaluation criteria.

\section{Final evaluation criteria}

The final evaluation criteria are based on the user tests on the
prototype. They're based on how well the user liked the use of social features
to handle schedule negotiation, if they perceive that it would make the job of
planning events easier for them. In addition, the design will be evaluated for
usability and privacy concerns.

\chapter{Results}

\section{Status of application / prototype}

The prototype that was created during this project was a very focused working
prototype, supporting three different scenarios regarding schedule
conflicts. The prototype has many simplifications done to speed up the creation
process and to remove elements that are unnecessary during the user tests the
prototype are aimed at.

The scenarios supported are gone through one-by one during each session, chosen
with a set of radio buttons on the first screen as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:scenario}. This screen is only used to drive the user tests, and as
such will not be evaluated against any criteria.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{scenario}
  \caption{The scenario selection screen}
  \label{fig:scenario}
\end{figure}

In the prototype the user can go through the event creation procedure and handle
conflicts in different ways, supporting two different conflict types, major and
minor.

The event creation screen, shown in Figure \ref{fig:creation}, is not fully
featured in any way, only allowing the user to input the minimum amount of
information required to create an event. This was done so the user would focus
less on critiquing the actual screen, and more on the actual procedure of
inviting and handling schedule conflicts.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{eventcreation}
  \caption{The event creation screen}
  \label{fig:creation}
\end{figure}

This screen also allows the user to invite friends by clicking on the
appropriate button, which pops up the screen shown in Figure
\ref{fig:invitation}, allowing the user to select which of their friends to
invite. The list is a standard Android ListView with an invite button at the
bottom, which the user has to scroll down to find.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{invitation}
  \caption{The invitation screen}
  \label{fig:invitation}
\end{figure}

The friends available in the prototype were randomly generated from a preset
list of names when the application is first launched, to give the user some data
to work with without requiring a lengthy input session beforehand.

When the user is done inviting friends, and click the invite button, they are
taken back to the event creation screen with their invited friends in a list, as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:invited}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{invited}
  \caption{Invited friends}
  \label{fig:invited}
\end{figure}

When the user then presses the button marked ``Create event'' and there are no
conflicts, a notification pops up saying that the event has been created and the
user is taken back to the scenario selection screen.

If there are conflicts (as is the case with the two last scenarios on the list),
then one of two dialogs can pop up. For a minor conflict (defined as 20\% of the
invited guests) the dialog in Figure \ref{fig:minor} pops up, allowing the user
to either ignore the warning or review the conflicts.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{minor}
  \caption{The minor conflict dialog}
  \label{fig:minor}
\end{figure}

For a major conflict (defined as 60\% of the invited guests) the dialog in
Figure \ref{fig:major} pops up, prompting the user to reschedule the event, or
review the conflicts.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{major}
  \caption{The major conflict dialog}
  \label{fig:major}
\end{figure}

Both of these dialogs give the user access to the screen in Figure
\ref{fig:resolve} for reviewing conflicts. On this screen, the user can see who
has schedule conflicts, what event is the cause of the conflict, and has the
option of removing them from the invite list.

The events listed under the conflicting users are chosen randomly from a
predefined list at the time of showing the conflicts, to give a little
randomness to every test.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{resolution}
  \caption{The conflict resolution screen}
  \label{fig:resolve}
\end{figure}

When the user chooses to reschedule the event from the major conflict dialog,
the application takes the user back to the event creation screen. The time and
date selectors are now highlighted, as in Figure \ref{fig:reschedule}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=50mm]{reschedule}
  \caption{The reschedule highlight}
  \label{fig:reschedule}
\end{figure}

When the user clicks the create event button again (regardless of whether the
time/date is changed or not) the event will then be created successfully,
another simplification done during the creation of the prototype.

\section{Final evaluation results}

Running the prototype through user tests proved enlightening. They showed that the
basic idea was sound, but the interface of the prototype was perhaps too
simplistic and fragmented.

The interface for inviting friends proved confusing, as the users weren't aware
of the Invite button at the end of the list to begin with, and there was no menu
option that performed the same function. They would either discover it by
accident while scrolling through the list, or have to be told where it was
located.

When it came to discovering and handling conflicts, the users agreed that the
functionality was promising, but lacking implementation-wise. A common problem
was for the user to remember state between the event creation and conflict
resolution screens. They would forget what time the event was set, and had to go
back and forth between the conflict resolution screen and the event information,
which in the prototype is an arduous task. There was also indication that the
choice of what to do during a schedule conflict is not obvious before the user
knows who is on the conflict list.

Most of the users found the conflict resolution screen easy to use and
understand, but a bit under-featured, although some felt that the red X buttons
were not immediately understandable, and pulled attention away from the
descriptive text. In addition, some of the users wanted access to more actions
than just removing from the guest list. All of the users agreed that showing the
guests' events was helpful in deciding what to do with a conflict, but almost
all agreed that showing the time as well would be even more helpful.

Users lamented the fact the system wasn't smarter and more autonomous, and
proposed that perhaps the system could first try automatically resolving the
conflict, particularly in minor ones. This would allow it to propose suitable
times for rescheduling, automatically mark certain guests as ``points of
interest'' and give recommendations when resolving conflicts.

In addition, some of the users showed concerns with the threshold values set for
minor and major conflicts, and wished that they were configurable, and the idea
of prioritizing friends so that certain friends were more important when
considering if a conflict is worth reporting was brought up. This point was also
brought up in similar research\cite{benhassine07,haynes97:_autom_meetin_sched_system}.

In summary, the interface as created in this prototype was workable, but could
do with some streamlining. The current flow hides crucial information behind a
dialog, and doesn't allow the user to go back and forth easily (as the dialog
will pop back up every time). In addition, the system is not as automated as it
could be, but it is a step in the right direction.

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Success(es)}

This has succeeded beyond, and in a wildly different direction than, what was
initially expected. It has gone through an entire design cycle, with the end
result of a functional prototype being tested with real users for a deep look at
a narrow bit of functionality, as opposed to the initial plan of making paper
prototypes for a shallow look at a wider area of the system.

This deep look has unearthed an interesting merger of old and new technology,
namely using data from social networks and social graphs and combining that with
semi-autonomous agents. It has shown that the functionality envisioned as the
end result of this project is actually desirable for end users and could be
developed into something very useful if more research went into it.

The prototype itself showed to be, despite its simplicity, good enough to elicit
useful feedback on the conflict resolution process itself, instead of leading
users to comment on the design of the interface itself. In addition, the user
tests done with a working prototype allowed the users to play around with the
interface and come up with ideas for improvements they might not have with a
less engaging paper prototype.

\section{Flaw(s)}

The project was not without its flaws, chief of which was the wasteful use of
time, leading to there being no iteration over the design to improve the
prototype and get even more feedback.

The biggest cause of this was heavily underestimating the amount of time that
would be spent learning the Android SDK, although the change of focus from wide
paper prototype to narrow functional prototype in the middle of the project did
contribute.

The prototype itself had some notable flaws, the most obvious one being that the
data used in the prototype was not real. A user won't relate to fake people as
much as they would to real friends, so the user testing lost its ``personal
touch'', which does affect the outcome and how serious the user would be about
the process. This came out clearly with some users who were clearly not taking
the decisions they had to make seriously.

During the user tests, a big problem with the idea of automatically notifying
event creators about schedule conflicts and allowing them to remove guests from
the invite list based on that information came up. The users expressed concern
that they would lose the ability to choose between conflicting events for
themselves, and that giving only the option to remove guests from the invite
list would lead to them missing out on things they would want to do.

Users also voiced concerns about the privacy implications of the idea, which is
something that wasn't well explored during this project, but should have been,
as having users be able to hide event information could impact the usefulness of
the idea.

\section{What did I learn}

During the project I learned that doing tests with real users can give you very
useful and unique insights that you would never get by just using frameworks and
heuristics to design an application. I was constantly surprised by how small
statements or concerns voiced by users would open my eyes to something I had
never considered or change my opinion on something I had taken for granted. I
was already aware of this fact, but nevertheless I was taken by surprise by how
many insights just five people can give you.

Regarding the goal of the project, I learned that there is a real opportunity to
harness the power of social networks, combine it with the work done on
(semi-)autonomous agents, and create something that would both simplify a task
and give users the ability to make more informed choices at the same time. There
is a lot of exciting work that could be (and presumably is) done in this area.

Lastly I learned is that time-management is essential to a good project, and
that constant, slow progress is much better for your nerves than working in
spurts of extreme activity. I wish I knew this before I started.

\section{What would I do different}

If I were to do this project over again, I would start out by narrowing down my
focus a lot earlier, as such I would have arrived on the goal of a functional
prototype much earlier. That would have given me enough time to perform several
iterations over the prototype, answering many of the exciting questions that are
currently unanswered.

I would have liked to have looked into Android programming earlier, as it would
have given a less bare-bones prototype, as I would have been more familiar with
how the platform does things and what ways to expose functionality.

I would also consider using more real data, perhaps by having the prototype
import a friend list from Facebook or something similar, although I would have
to weigh the privacy concerns against the benefits.

\section{Next steps - future work}

First of all, further work should improve the interface and flow of the
prototype to make it feel more natural and not keep the user away from
information they might need. Giving the user more actions to perform on the
conflict resolution screen should be explored, as an addition to just the remove
button.

Various user preferences should be explored, particularly when it comes to the
thresholds for minor and major conflicts, but also as pertains to the importance
of certain friends. Work should also be done on looking how information from the
social graph could be used to ``prime'' these values, or make them dynamic and
unnecessary to set by hand.

One very interesting topic to explore would be making the system more autonomous
in general, having it recommend times for rescheduling, automatically marking
friends for removal or other things. More inspiration could be taken from the
work on semi-autonomous agents, and have the application represent each user by
an agent which would negotiate on the user's behalf based on data from the
social graph or preferences set beforehand, as mentioned.

As Dey and Abowd say\cite{dey99:towar}: ``In handheld and ubiquitous computing,
a user's context is very dynamic. When using applications in these settings,
user has much to gain by the effective use of implicitly sensed context''
. Future work should look into the possibilities of using context to aid the
negotiation process.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the project has gone through one full design iteration, and has
as a result raised many exciting new questions. There is a lot more work to be
done before the application designed during this project is in any way ready to
be used, but the prototype shows promise.

I believe that the project has only scratched the surface of an area that could
be very exciting to look at, the merging of the social graph with agent
technology to create semi-autonomous social agents that can take many decisions
based on dynamic, social information easily available in networks such as
Facebook.
