App idea: Collaborative event planner

The idea is to make planning simple informal simpler, and to give people an
easier way to find stuff their friends want to do close to them.

The app is centered around a map-based view of events or happenings within a
certain timespan, that allows a person to see things their friends are planning
or are proposing to do, ranging from "hey, we're having coffee here, you're
welcome to join", through "we're having a vorspiel here at this and this time,
what do people want to do?" to "I want to do something, ideas?"

A social graph is used to highlight events that are interesting to you, so that
you know if people you like going to events to are planning to be there, and can
plan accordingly. This graph could be primed via Facebook import, f.ex.

To do this, you need to be able to create and maintain a friend list somehow,
with import through other providers (facebook, twitter, etc), so that you can
only get events that pertain to you. Updates to events you are planning to
attend should notify you, with the option of setting different notification
levels.

Participators should also be able to link various forms of media taken from the
event, like photos and video recordings, and possibly link in facebook photo
albums or albums from elsewhere.
