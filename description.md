App idea: Collaborative event planner

The idea is to make planning events, simple or complex, simpler, and to give
people an easier way to find stuff their friends want to do close to them.

The app is centered around a map-based view of events or happenings within a
certain timespan, that allows a person to see things their friends are planning
or are proposing to do, ranging from "hey, we're having coffee here, you're
welcome to join", through "we're having a vorspiel here at this and this time,
what do people want to do?" and all the way up to huge concerts and public
events.

To do this, you need to be able to create and maintain a friend list somehow,
possibly through other providers (facebook, twitter, etc), so that you can only
get events that pertain to you. Events need to be able to be open, invite-only
or friends-only, and you need to be able to appoint planners, and have a list of
participating people. Updates to events should be subscribable, so that you get
a phone notification if something changes.

Participators should also be able to link various forms of media taken from the
event, like photos and video recordings, and possibly link in facebook photo
 albums or albums from elsewhere.
